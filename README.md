► In this Repository I practiced my React.js skills. Used map method, different components and props in order to rander an array with lots of information.

▶︎ In this React App you can find the best moment I shared with J🐶Y, my sport pug. Feel free to delete the content in my components and try as a practice to restore my solution.\*
